<h1> Chat Room App</h1>

***

The Chat Room App is a straightforward tutorial-based project that I embarked on to familiarise myself with the WebSocket protocol and its benefits of simultaneous and bi-directional communication compared to HTTP. 
The project primarily focuses on the back-end logic and understanding how WebSockets work. 
It utilizes Spring Boot to create a real-time application, allowing seamless communication between client and server. 
The front end of the application uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with the main goal of showcasing the back-end functionality.
